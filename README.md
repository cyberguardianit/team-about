CyberGuardian IT is a team brought together by Code Fellows, that has been tasked with assisting a small micro-satellite company, NanoSphere Technology, with the necessities needed for expanding. Currently, the company works from a converted garage, but with new funding from grants and investments, NanoSphere tech would like to focus on hiring more engineers and non-technical employees. 

NanoSphere would like our organization to prioritize information security and place an emphasis on the safeguarding of their intellectual property. Therefore, they are adamant that their technical designs are not stored on the cloud, and only leaves their primary site in the form of offsite backups.
